# Tutorial
For A.  With the given **xyz coordinate values for points** and **attribute values**
    for the points, plot a 4D figure and fit a semi-ellipsoid.

>   Run *MyPatch.m* which will call functions *ellipsoid_ex2im.m*,
>   *ellipsoid_im2ex.m*, *ellipsoidfit.m*, *ellipsoidfit_iterative.m*,
>   *ellipsoidfit_residuals.m*, *ellipsoidfit_simple.m*, *is_ellipsoid.m*,
>   *rot2quat.m*, *quat2rot.m*, *plot_ellipsoid.m*, using **xyz.xls** and point
>   **attribute.xls** as inputs and outputting a 4D figure and a fitted figure.

For B.  With the given **xy coordinate values for a dotted trace** (in Excel sheet
    1; data in a column for a trace) and **attribute values** for each trace (in
    sheet 2; values in a column corresponding to a trace sharing the same column
    number) for the terminal points, plot the traces with the exaggerated
    terminal dots in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system and column-shaped
    sub-heatmaps arranged based on the y-value of the terminal dots forming a
    ring-shaped heatmap. A line indicates a sub-heatmap to its corresponding
    trace via connecting to the terminal dot.

>   Run *Circle_first_rotate_supernova.m* which will call functions *Block.m*,
>   *LinkAxes.m*, *shrink.m*, and *shrink2.m*, using data in one.xls as input
>   and outputting a Cartesian coordinate system surrounded by a ring-shaped
>   heatmap.
