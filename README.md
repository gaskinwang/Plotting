# Tutorial
For A.  With the given **xyz coordinate values for points** and **attribute values**
    for the points, plot a 4D figure and fit a semi-ellipsoid.

>   Run MyPatch.m which will call ellipsoid_ex2im.m, ellipsoid_im2ex.m,
>   ellipsoidfit.m, ellipsoidfit_iterative.m, ellipsoidfit_residuals.m,
>   ellipsoidfit_simple.m, is_ellipsoid.m, rot2quat.m, quat2rot.m,
>   plot_ellipsoid.m, using **xyz.xls** and point **attribute.xls** as inputs
>   and outputting a 4D figure and a fitted figure.
